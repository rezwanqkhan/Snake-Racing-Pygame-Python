# Snake and Racing Games

This repository contains two simple games implemented in Python using the Pygame library: a classic Snake game and a basic racing game.

## Snake Game

The Snake game allows players to control a snake as it moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. Players must avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body. The game keeps track of the player's score as they consume food and displays it on the screen.

## Racing Game

The racing game puts players in control of a car as they navigate through a track filled with obstacles. Players can move their car left and right to avoid collisions with obstacles. The game keeps track of the player's score based on the distance traveled and displays it on the screen.

Both games provide simple yet enjoyable gameplay experiences and serve as fun projects for beginners learning Python game development.
